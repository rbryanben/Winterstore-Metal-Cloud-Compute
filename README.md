# Winterstore-Metal-Cloud-Compute
Metal as a Service that allows user to rent virtual computers on which to run their own computer applications. Based on a Type 2 Hypervisor on the road to Type 1 Bare Metal

# Road To Bare Metal
Popular MaaS providers like AWS and Google Cloud do not use a type 2 hypervisor to run guest operating systems. 
They use Type 1 hypervisors like Xen Hypervisor-Citrix Project to give bare metal perfomance. This repo is the journey to building a MaaS that is based on a Type 1 Hypervisor Xen
, and our first stop is a MaaS platform that is based on a Type 2 hypervisor (VirtualBox) just to get the concept straight.
